 --> Angular :- Javascript Framework
    -> Used to develop UI
    -> Create SPA
    -> Maintained by google
    -> Component Based Architecture

    --> Environmental Setup
    -> Node js environment
    -> Download and install node js
    version >14.0
    When we install node npm is install with it
    -> npm : node package manager (all 3rd party package are download and install with npm )
    -> We need angular cli (command line interface) (ng :- new generate)
    -> Install angular cli
    npm install @angular/cli --g
    -> to check cli is install or not
    ng

    -> How we create angular app
    ng new appName
    -> How we run angular app
    -> open app folder in cmd|terminal
    ng serve --o (angular app is open in default browser in port 4200)
    ng server --port 4201 --o

    --> How angular application is boot (execute)
    index.html
    <app-root></app-root>
    ----> src/main.ts (main entry point file) ---> boot default module (AppModule)src/app/app.module.ts ---> boot -->
    default component (AppComponent) src/app/app.component.ts
    selector:'app-root',
    templateURL:'app.component.html'

    --> components :- are the core building block of the angular app. They used for reusability. Every component have
    their own design (html) and logic(.ts)
    -> How we create components
    ng g c componentName
    componentName(folder)
    .ts
    .html
    .css
    .spec.ts (testing)
    Auto update in AppModule
    selector:'app-componentName'

    -> to call a component in another component we have
    <app-componentName></app-componentName>
    -> Design
    Home About Gallery Services
    <div>
        //load all dynamic components when page is load
    </div>

    --> Routing :- It is a process for navigate between multiple pages into a single page. With the help of routing we
    can develop SPA only.
    -> default :- app-routing.module.ts
    RouterModule :- to load all routes
    Routes :- we define path
    hyperlink :- routerLink
    <router-outlet></router-outlet> :- It is a container where dynamic components are load when a URL is match with the
    Routes

    --> Dynamic Data Binding
    -> {{ }} :- expression
    -> If we want to render array or object
    *ngFor
    -> Event Binding ()
    <button (click)="abc()"> Click Here </button>
    -> Property Binding []
    .ts
    imageURL="--"
    .html
    <img [src]="imageURL" />
    -> 2 way data binding :- combination of Property and Event Binding [()]
    -> ngModel and we use this with the help of FormsModule
    -> 1st load FormsModule in AppModule
    app.module.ts
    import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms';
    imports:[FormsModule]
